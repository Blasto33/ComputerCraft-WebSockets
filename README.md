## General info

Hi, welcome on this tutorial to learn how to basicly use WebSockets for CC: Tweaked. This tutorial won't cover the very basic of WebSockets. If you do not know how they operate and you can't make it to the end of this tutorial, I won't be able to help you. But don't worry, there is a plenty of web pages about it on the Internet.

I'm making this tutorial because I wasn't able to find a single good one that explains everything. So I spent a few hours looking for documentation, testing and running my scripts to provide you this. If it helped you, you can star the repo, it will be a huge compensation for me!

## Setup

### Prerequisite

You'll need a couple of things before starting. This is a tutorial but it seems obvious that I can't do everything for you.
I hope you know what is CC: Tweaked (otherwise, why are you even here?) but I'll explain briefly to you why we use this mod and not Computer Craft.
In fact, it is very simple: ComputerCraft does not handle WebSockets. So make sure you install CC: Tweaked on your Minecraft (any version is good).
